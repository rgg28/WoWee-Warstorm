// WoW packed-time unpacking - the one uint32 that carries a whole date.
//
// Four places in this client unpacked this field and no two agreed; every one
// of them was wrong. The values are what make it dangerous: a date read with
// the wrong shifts still comes out as a plausible day and month, so nothing
// looks broken until someone checks a date they know.
//
// The expectations here are built the way the server builds the field, from
// ByteBuffer::AppendPackedTime:
//
//     (tm_year - 100) << 24 | tm_mon << 20 | (tm_mday - 1) << 14
//                           | tm_wday << 11 | tm_hour << 6 | tm_min
