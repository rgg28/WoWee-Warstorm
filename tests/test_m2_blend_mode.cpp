// reasonable - blending by an alpha that is 1 everywhere draws solid, so
// cutting out at least keeps the artist's silhouette.

// For the additive modes it destroys the effect. Additive does not use alpha
// for transparency: black is what disappears, because adding zero changes
// nothing. Glow cards are authored exactly that way - an opaque texture,
// bright in the middle and black at the edges.
