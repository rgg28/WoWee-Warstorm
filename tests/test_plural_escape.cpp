// WoW's |4singular:plural; escape.
//
// The interface writes a counted thing as one string and leaves the ending to
// the client: SECONDS is "|4Second:Seconds;" and CAMP_TIMER is
// "%d %s until logout". Nothing resolved it, so the logout prompt showed
// "5 |4Second:Seconds; until logout" exactly as written. Seventy-five strings
// in this interface use it, so the same was true of every countdown, every
// "N players", every "N quests".
//
// The rule is inferred rather than documented here, which is why it is pinned:
// the ending is chosen by the last number *before* the escape.
