// Which LightParams row and channel a light band belongs to, and where its
// fields are.
//
// LightIntBand and LightFloatBand hold one row per channel per LightParams
// row: eighteen colour channels and six float channels. Two things about that
// were wrong, and either alone leaves a zone with no colours of its own.
//
// The block mapping was `id / channels` and `id % channels`. Both the band ids
// and the LightParams ids start at one, so band 1 - the first colour channel
// of LightParams 1 - came out as LightParams 0, channel 1. LightParams 0 does
// not exist, so the first seventeen channels of every row were dropped, and
// the rest landed one slot over.
//
// The field indices were shifted by one too. LightIntBand.dbc is 34 fields:
// the id, a count, sixteen times, sixteen values. The layout declared the
// count at field 2, which is the first time key, so 12024 of the file's 15300
// bands read as having zero keyframes.
//
// The oracle is the files. The counts settle the mapping - 15300 rows is
// 850 x 18 and the ids run to 16506, which is 917 x 18 - and the values in
// field 2 settle the field shift: 1440, 2160, 360, 720 are times of day in
// half-minutes, not counts of anything.
