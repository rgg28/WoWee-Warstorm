// The sort block on the end of CMSG_AUCTION_LIST_ITEMS.
//
// It used to be a hardcoded zero - no columns, no ordering - and the browse
// tab's column headers did nothing at all as a result. Not "sorted only the
// page on hand": nothing. The browse tab does not reorder what it already has,
// it re-asks with the ordering attached (AuctionFrame_OnClickSortColumn calls
// AuctionFrameBrowse_Search for "list" rather than SortAuctionApplySort), so
// an empty sort block is the whole answer.
//
// Two orderings have to agree for this to work and they run opposite ways:
//
//   * The interface pushes keys least significant first. GetAuctionSort(table,
//     1) returns the *primary*, and it reads keys.size() - index for exactly
//     that reason.
//   * AzerothCore's AuctionSorter walks its vector from begin() and returns on
//     the first column that separates two rows, so its front entry is primary.
//
// So the client's list is reversed on the way out. Reversed twice, or not at
// all, and a two-column sort silently orders by the tiebreaker - which looks
// almost right, which is what makes it worth pinning.
//
// Checked against WorldSession::HandleAuctionListItems, which reads guid,
// listfrom, name, levelmin, levelmax, auctionSlotID, auctionMainCategory,
// auctionSubCategory, quality, usable, getAll, then a uint8 count and that
// many (sortMode, isDesc) pairs.
//
// This covers the block, not its position in the packet. The builder's
// translation unit reaches the splines and the crypto through a shared facade,
// so linking it here would mean pulling in half the client to check six bytes
// - and building the packet by hand instead would test a copy of the code
// rather than the code. The block is the part with a convention to get wrong;
// where it sits is one line above it in the builder and covered by the
// layout sweeps.
