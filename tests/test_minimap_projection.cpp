// It was written out longhand three times in game_screen_minimap.cpp - once
// forward for markers, once inverted for the ctrl+click ping, once inverted
// again for the coordinate tooltip. Two copies of an inverse is two chances to
// get a sign wrong, and a wrong sign there pings the mirror image of where you
// clicked. FrameXML's Minimap:PingLocation would have been a fourth.
//
// The contract is not "north is up". It is that this projection is the exact
// inverse of what minimap_display.frag.glsl does, because that shader is what
// decides where a piece of the world is on screen - a marker is right when it
// lands on the ground it names, whatever direction that ground is drawn in.
// So the shader is reproduced here and the two are composed.
