// The movement flag bits, against the values the server uses.
//
// These are a bitfield on every movement packet, read in both directions: the
// server tells the client to start water walking by sending an opcode, the
// client sets the bit, and every movement packet it sends afterwards carries
// it. Get a bit wrong and the client both fails to see the state it was put
// into and asserts a different state it was never in.
//
// FEATHER_FALL was 0x4000 and WATER_WALK 0x8000. Those are PENDING_STOP and
// PENDING_STRAFE_STOP - flags the server sets during ordinary movement - while
// the real bits are 0x20000000 and 0x10000000. So a player under slow fall or
// water walking told the server, in every packet, that they were in a pending
// stop.
//
// The oracle is AzerothCore's UnitDefines.h, read once and recorded here.
// Comparing the whole enum against it by bit found those two of twenty-three.
