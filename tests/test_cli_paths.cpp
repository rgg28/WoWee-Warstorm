// Finding the files of one format under a directory.
//
// Most editor commands take a directory and work on every file of a format
// under it. Eleven walked the tree themselves for .wom alone, each repeating
// recurse, match the extension, and cut the extension off because the loaders
// take a base path and append it again.
//
// The copies had drifted in ways that only show at the edges: some guarded the
// cut with a length check and some did not, and some handed the iterator an
// error_code while others let it throw on a directory they could not read.
// None of them sorted, so a listing named its files in the filesystem's own
// order - neither creation order nor alphabetical, and not the same on another
// machine - and every tie in a later sort inherited it.
//
// The oracle is a directory built by the test rather than the old code: the
// files that should be found are the ones it wrote.
