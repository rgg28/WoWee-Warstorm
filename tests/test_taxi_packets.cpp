// CMSG_ACTIVATETAXIEXPRESS - the multi-hop flight request.
//
// A total cost was being written between the guid and the node count, and
// HandleActivateTaxiExpressOpcode does not read one. So the server took the
// cost as the number of nodes to expect and read the client's own count as the
// first node - a small number that is no taxi node anyone has visited, which it
// answers with ERR_TAXINOTVISITED. A multi-hop flight was refused for a flight
// point the player had certainly been to, and with a large enough cost the
// server ran off the end of the buffer and dropped the packet instead.
//
// Single hops go through CMSG_ACTIVATETAXI and were unaffected, which is why
// only longer routes ever failed. These pin the shape against what the server
// reads.
