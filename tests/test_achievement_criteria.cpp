// The criteria progress record, whose counter is a packed guid.
//
// It was read as a fixed uint64. A counter of five is two bytes on the wire and
// not eight, so the read swallowed the player guid behind it and every field
// after was out of place. In SMSG_ALL_ACHIEVEMENT_DATA, where the records
// repeat until an id of -1, the first misread took the whole list: the sentinel
// was never where the reader looked, so it kept reading noise as ids until the
// packet ran out.
//
// Nothing about that fails loudly. The panel drew a number for every criteria
// and the numbers were wrong, which is only visible to someone who knows what
// the right one is. So the layout is pinned here against packets built the way
// AzerothCore builds them - appendPackGUID and all.
