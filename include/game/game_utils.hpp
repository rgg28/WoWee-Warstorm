/// heartbeat, the area-trigger sweep - and all of them ask this.

/// The test used to be a thousand units square, which is not "the origin" on
/// map 0: Hillsbrad sits inside it. Standing in Southshore, every heartbeat
/// was blocked, so the server went on believing the player was wherever they
