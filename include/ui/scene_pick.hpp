// The left-click target picker and the right-click world picker each grew their
// own copy of this traversal. They agreed on everything that matters - how a
// unit is ranked against an object, that a hostile is preferred, that a corpse
// must not outrank the living - and had to be edited in lockstep to stay that
// way, which is exactly how one of them quietly diverges. What genuinely
// differs between them is expressed as parameters instead.
