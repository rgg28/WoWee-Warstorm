/**
 * The on-screen controls a phone needs, and nothing a desktop does.
 *
 * A touch screen already drives most of this client. SDL reports the first
 * finger as a mouse, so taps press buttons and a drag orbits the camera exactly
 * as a held left button does, and every panel, slider and action button works
 * without knowing a finger touched it. Two things a finger cannot do are hold W
 * and turn a wheel. Those are what this adds.
 *
 * It reads the finger events SDL sends alongside the mouse ones, and claims
 * only what it needs: a thumb in the lower-left corner becomes a movement
 * stick, and two fingers spreading become the camera zoom. Everything else is
 * left alone.
 *
 * The stick's own finger is also the one SDL is reporting as a held mouse
 * button, which would orbit the camera the whole time the player walked. So
 * while the stick is held the camera is told to ignore mouse motion. That is
 * the one place this has to reach outside itself.
