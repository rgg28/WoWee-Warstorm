// A retained widget tree with WoW's anchor layout.
//
// This is the thing the addon API was missing. CreateFrame answered, events
// dispatched, and CreateTexture handed back a table whose every method was a
// no-op - so an addon could compute and react but could not put a pixel on the
// screen. The API looked supported and nothing drew.
//
// The same tree is what FrameXML targets, because FrameXML is only Lua and XML
// over a widget system. Building it once serves both: addons that draw, and a
// route to running the original interface rather than imitating it.
//
// Deliberately free of Vulkan and ImGui so the layout rules can be tested
// without a device. Rendering lives in widget_renderer.
//
// Coordinates follow WoW, not the screen: the origin is the BOTTOM-left and y
// grows upward. Converting at the point of drawing keeps every anchor rule here
// readable against Blizzard's own documentation, rather than mirrored.
