 * every keystroke and stops there - and for these three, taking the key is
 * what lets go of the box. The per-frame poll then runs later in the same
 * iteration, asks whether the interface is taking typed input, and is told no,
 * truthfully, by the box that let go on this very press:
 *
 *  - **Escape** closes the box. The Escape chain then ran on top and put the
 *    game menu up behind the box the player had just dismissed.
 *  - **Enter** sends the line and ends in `ChatEdit_OnEscapePressed`, which
 *    hides the box. Enter is also this client's open-chat key, so sending a
 *    message reopened the box on the same press.
 *  - **Tab** is handed to the box's own handler, which is where the interface
 *    moves between fields - and the target key is Tab.
 *
 * A flag rather than a consumed key, because ImGui's IsKeyPressed does not
 * consume: both sites see the same press whatever either does with it.
