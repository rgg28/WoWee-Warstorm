// Vulkan device. This half is the part that needs one.

// Textures come from the game's own Interface\ art through the existing asset
// path - read the BLP, upload it, hand ImGui the descriptor set - which is the
// same route the action bar already takes for its backpack button. Nothing new
// is shipped; it is the player's own install being drawn.
