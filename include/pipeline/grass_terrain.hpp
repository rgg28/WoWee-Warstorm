// Whether grass grows at a point on the terrain, and what kind.
//
// The answer is already in the ADT and must not be re-derived: each texture
// layer carries a ground-effect id, and an effect with no density is Blizzard
// saying "no vegetation here". Roads, cliffs and bare dirt already carry that.
// A classifier of our own would disagree with the map, and the map is right.
//
// The density lookup arrives as a callback rather than a TerrainManager
// reference: the table lives in the rendering layer, and this has no business
// depending on it or on a GPU to be tested.
