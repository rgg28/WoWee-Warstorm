/// assignments, written twice, forty lines apart.

/// Nothing about a field missing from one copy fails. The sky simply looks
/// different depending on whether parallel recording is on, which is a setting
/// most people never touch and nobody would think to bisect against. The last
/// three fields were added to both copies by hand, and the fourth would have
/// been too.
