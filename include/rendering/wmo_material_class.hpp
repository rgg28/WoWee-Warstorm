/// Deciding which WMO materials are drawn as glass.
///
/// The glass path picks a material up when its texture path contains "window"
/// or "glass", and gives it a Fresnel term, a blue reflection tint and a
/// specular highlight. Across the 2392 root WMOs the client ships, 143
/// distinct textures match that name, on 835 materials.
///
/// Most of them should be glass and look right. Some are not glass at all:
/// they are walls with window openings painted or cut into them, and the
/// ruined guard towers of Tirisfal are the case that showed it. Their
/// TOWER_WINDOW_01 is a plain stone wall - MOMT flags 0x0, blend mode 0, and a
/// BLP with no alpha channel at all - so the whole upper tower came out
/// looking glazed.
///
/// WHY THIS IS A LIST AND NOT A RULE
///
/// There is no property of the data that separates the two. Measured over all
/// 143 textures:
///
///   * the authored flags do not. F_WINDOW (0x20) and F_SIDN (0x10) are set on
///     the Booty Bay and Blood Elf windows and not on Stormwind's, and the
///     ruined tower carries neither - but neither does Uldaman's stained
///     glass.
///   * the alpha channel does not. MM_STRMWND_WINDOWS_01 has one and
///     AM_BBAY_WINDOWS, which is a lit window, does not.
///
/// Either test alone drops around 400 materials that currently look correct.
/// So the default stays what it was, and what is known not to be glass is
/// named here one texture at a time.
///
/// ADDING TO THE LIST
///
/// A texture belongs here when the surface is stone or wood with window
/// shapes on it rather than a pane. Add the file name, lower case, and say
/// where it was seen.
