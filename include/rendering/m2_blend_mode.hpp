/// What an M2 material's blend mode means for the pipeline it draws on.
///
/// A batch whose texture carries no alpha channel used to be forced onto the
/// cutout pipeline whenever its blend mode was 2 or higher. For blend mode 2 -
/// alpha blend - that is reasonable: blending by an alpha that is 1 everywhere
/// is the same as drawing opaque, so cutting out at least gives the artist's
/// silhouette a chance.
///
/// For the additive modes it is wrong, and destroys the effect. Additive does
/// not use alpha for transparency at all - black is what disappears, because
/// adding zero changes nothing. A glow card is authored exactly that way: an
/// opaque texture, bright in the middle, black at the edges.
///
/// Orgrimmar's bonfire is the case that showed it. Its glow is
/// GENERICGLOW_ALPHA_128.BLP - named for an alpha it does not have, alphaDepth
/// 0 in the file - on a material with blend mode 4. Forced to cutout, every
/// texel passed the test and the flame rendered as a flat opaque grey disc
/// sitting behind the logs.

/// is: it has nothing to test and does not need one.
///
/// An alpha key over a texture with no transparent texel is the case worth
/// naming. Every texel passes, so the test decides nothing - but it still puts
/// the batch on the cutout pipeline, where alpha-to-coverage decides how much
/// of each sample the batch covers. Tirisfal's canopy trees are two batches,
/// and their trunk is exactly this: TirrisFallCanopyTree01_Trunk is DXT1 with
/// no punch-through block anywhere in it, drawn alpha-keyed.
///
/// Canopytree07, the one of the seven whose trunk is plain opaque, was read
/// here as the one that rendered right. It was not. Its trunk samples
/// SilverPineTree01TrunkSkin, which does carry alpha, and the foliage rule in
/// m2_renderer_render.cpp forced it onto the cutout pipeline whatever this
/// function said - so it had the same hole through its middle that every
/// Silverpine tree had. Opaque was not reaching the pipeline at all until that
/// rule learned to ask BLPImage::alphaIsSilhouette.

/// the key actively destroys it: a glow card is a radial gradient from black
