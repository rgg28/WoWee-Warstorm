/**
 * geoset_rules.hpp - how a character geoset id is chosen when a model does not
 * have the one that was asked for.
 *
 * A geoset id is a group and a variant: group * 100 + variant. The members of a
 * group are alternatives for one part of a character - five kinds of boot, six
 * kinds of cloak - so when a model does not carry the exact variant asked for,
 * another member of the same group is usually the right answer.
 *
 * Usually. Variant 1 means NONE - bare feet, no cloak, no beard - and so does
 * variant 0 where a DBC stores the variant directly and uses zero for absent.
 * Every other member of the group is *something*, so substituting for none does
 * not approximate it, it contradicts it. That single mistake produced three
 * separate faults: a clean-shaven NPC with a beard, a character with no cloak
 * wearing an untextured one, and a player with no feet.
 *
 * It produced them three times because this rule was written five times, as a
 * local lambda in each place that needed it, and only some of them learned it.
 * It lives here now, with a test, and the call sites ask rather than decide.
