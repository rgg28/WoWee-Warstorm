 * addon_lua_snippets.hpp - the Lua this client injects into the interface.
 *
 * Two of these are long enough to hide a mistake in: the options panels, which
 * build twelve categories of control out of the settings schema, and the coin
 * clearance, which reaches into MoneyFrame_Update. They lived as raw string
 * literals inside the functions that ran them, where a syntax error is not a
 * build failure - executeString simply answers false and the client carries on
 * with a warning in a log that is warning-only.
 *
 * Out here they can be handed to Lua by a test, which is the only way a
