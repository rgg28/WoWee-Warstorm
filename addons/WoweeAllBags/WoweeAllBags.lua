-- Every carried bag in one window. The bank is FrameXML's own.
--
-- The bank was a third section here, reached by a Bank button where the
-- caption would be, so opening the bank replaced the view of what you were
-- carrying with what you had stored - at the one moment both are wanted, a
-- deposit being a move from one to the other. Giving it a window of this
-- window's own kind then put two bank windows on screen, since BankFrame opens
-- itself and holds the same items.
--
-- So the bank is Blizzard's, whole: the twenty-eight slots, the seven bag
-- slots and the purchase, drawn by the interface that already has all three.
-- This window is the carried bags and the keyring, and the calls that name a
-- bank bag are handed straight back to FrameXML.
--
-- 3.3.5's interface has no such thing: it opens one ContainerFrame per bag and
-- has no sorting at all, both of which arrived years later. This client's own
-- bag window had a combined view and a Sort Bags button for a long time, but
-- that is drawn by the client - hand the bags to FrameXML and it goes away with
-- them. This is the same idea built out of the ordinary addon API, so it is
-- there whichever side is drawing.
--
-- Nothing here is special-cased. GetContainerNumSlots, GetContainerItemInfo,
-- PickupContainerItem, GetItemQualityColor and GameTooltip:SetBagItem are the
-- interface's own, and SortBags is this client's, which runs the sort the bag
-- window already used.

-- SortBags sorts what the player is carrying, so on the bank it would have
-- been a button that quietly sorted a different window's contents.
--

-- the rarity ring, the drag, HandleModifiedItemClick - has to reach both, and
