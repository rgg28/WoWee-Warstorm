"""The settings loader's own statement of what each field will hold.

`GameScreen::loadSettings` clamps almost every value it reads, and that clamp is
the only machine-readable statement of a setting's range for the ones with no
schema row - which is exactly the six a Blizzard control drives. Two checks want
it, from different ends: one asks what a CVar's slider is allowed to hand to a
field, and one wants a value to perturb a config line to. They were parsing it
separately until tool_duplication_check said so.

Not a script. It defines the parse and nothing else, so importing it costs a
reader one hop rather than a second copy to keep in step.
