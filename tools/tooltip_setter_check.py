"""GameTooltip setters that answer with a no-op, so the tooltip comes up blank.

    tools/tooltip_setter_check.py

WHY THESE AND NOT ALL METHODS

A tooltip setter is the whole content of a tooltip. Every other widget method
that no-ops leaves something on screen that is merely wrong; a Set* on
GameTooltip that no-ops leaves an empty box, or nothing at all, and there is no
error and no partial result to notice. Fifty-one of them are called across the
interface and each belongs to a different panel, so one missing setter is one
panel's hover that says nothing while every other hover works.

WHAT IT SEPARATES

Three answers, and the third is the fault:

  * implemented - a C binding, or a method on __WoweeFrameMT written in the
    bootstrap Lua. Both count; the bootstrap ones are how most of these are
    written, since they are made of other bindings.
  * in the no-op allowlist - answered, silently, with nothing.
  * neither - these RAISE, and take the OnEnter down with them. Zero today,
    and that is the number to watch: it is the only one here that is loud.

WHAT IT FOUND

Eight blank on 2026-08-05, four of them fixed:

  * SetTradeTargetItem - SetTradePlayerItem was written and its twin was not,
    so hovering your own offer named the item and hovering theirs said
    nothing. An asymmetry rather than a decision.
  * SetShapeshift - the stance bar, which every druid, warrior, rogue, priest
    and death knight has on screen the whole time.
  * SetMerchantCostItem - what a vendor wants besides coin. The money frame
    draws one of these per cost item and the tooltip is the only place the
    badge or token is named.
  * SetLFGDungeonReward - the reward icons on the dungeon-ready popup.

THE FOUR LEFT, AND WHY EACH STAYS

  * SetQuestLogRewardSpell - GetQuestLogRewardSpell answers nil always, so
    there is nothing for the tooltip to say. Implementing it would move the
    blank one layer down.
  * SetLFGCompletionReward - GetLFGCompletionRewardItem's contract is a
    texture and a quantity. No name is available to print, which is why its
    dungeon-reward twin above could be written and this one could not.
  * SetEquipmentSet - the equipment manager, which a stock account has off:
    the equipmentManager CVar reads "0" and that is correct.
  * SetGlyph - Blizzard_GlyphUI, which arrives with the talent addon.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

Whether an implemented setter fills the tooltip *correctly*. It reads which of
three answers a name gets, not what comes out.
