"""Stubbed bindings that a handed-over element actually calls.

The readiness report counts a name as answered once it is bound, and a stub is
bound - so `HasPetSpells -> lua_ReturnNil` read as clean while it was hiding
the entire pet spell book. This asks the narrower question: which of the stubs
are on a code path that is on screen right now.

Being listed is not being wrong. Plenty of stubs are correct: the feature is
genuinely absent (vehicles, voice chat) or FrameXML tolerates the empty answer.
It is a reading list, ordered by how central the file is.

WHAT IT COULD NOT SEE UNTIL 2026-08-06

A stub written out in place. Only the named shared ones were recognised -
lua_ReturnNil and its family - so a lambda answering a literal from inside the
registration table counted as an implementation, which is exactly what a stub
is not. The count went from thirty-nine to a hundred and ninety-five.

The test is now that stripping the pushes and the return leaves nothing that
calls anything. Asking it the other way round - which sources does this body
read - kept failing in the same direction: GetActionBarPage keeps its page in a
Lua global, GetSelectedFaction and GetSelectedSkill keep theirs in C++ statics
behind an accessor, and all three are implementations that simply do not go
through the game handler.

Two of the newly visible are worth naming: GetQuestLogCompletionText answers ""
and GetQuestLogRequiredMoney answers 0, both to the quest log and the tracker.
Answering them needs SMSG_QUEST_QUERY_RESPONSE parsed further than it is - the
quest log entry carries neither field, and the packet that does carry them is
the turn-in one, which arrives only once the player is at the NPC.

THE FORTY THAT WERE CHECKED. The hundred and fifty-six that joined them have
not been.

THE FORTY IT REPORTS TODAY, ALL CHECKED

None is a defect, but three are worth knowing about because they are visible
rather than merely absent. Read once so the count can be watched rather than
re-triaged.

VISIBLE, AND DELIBERATE

  * GetBattlefieldInstanceRunTime - the scoreboard prints "Time Elapsed: 0
    seconds" rather than nothing, because worldstateframe.lua formats whatever
    it is given. The real answer is milliseconds since the *instance* started,
    which this client cannot know: it can measure since the player joined, and
    labelling that "Time Elapsed" would be confidently wrong for anyone who
    arrived late. A zero that reads as broken is better than a number that
    reads as true.
  * ShowContainerSellCursor, ShowBuybackSellCursor - the cursor does not change
    to the sell icon over a bag item at a vendor. This client's cursor has no
    such icon to change to.

ONE THAT IS ABSENT BY CHOICE RATHER THAN BY NECESSITY

The GM survey. Its questions come from four DBCs this install carries, not from
any packet - GMSurveyCurrentSurvey maps language to survey, GMSurveySurveys
lists the question ids, GMSurveyQuestions and GMSurveyAnswers hold the text -
and the trigger is the getSurvey byte in SMSG_GMRESPONSE_STATUS_UPDATE.
Submitting is what makes it work rather than merely appear, and that means
accumulating ten answers with per-question comments for CMSG_GMSURVEY_SUBMIT.
The panel is only reached after a game master closes a ticket.

Recorded because this file previously said the questions were unparseable,
which was read off the event's name rather than off the files sitting beside
it.

TWO THAT WERE CHECKED AND ARE GENUINELY ABSENT

Written down because three neighbouring claims of the same kind turned out to
be wrong - the refund window, the GM survey and vehicle state were all called
absent and all three were reachable. These two are not.

  * Voice chat. AzerothCore's handlers read the request and throw it away:
    HandleVoiceSessionEnableOpcode is two read_skips, HandleSetActiveVoiceChannel
    another two, HandleChannelVoiceOnOpcode an empty body with a comment. No
    SMSG_VOICE_* is ever sent, so there is no session to report on and nothing
    a binding could answer from.
  * Movie recording. The renderer can capture one frame - Renderer::captureScreenshot
    writes a PNG - and there is no encoder behind it. MovieRecording_* is video.

ABSENT FEATURES, WHICH IS WHAT THE STUB SAYS (28)

The world map's debug objects, zone map, battlefield flag and vehicle
positions, dungeon map floors and Wintergrasp timer; Battle.net and its friend
list; voice chat and mutes; movie recording; mail stationery; achievement
comparison; arena opponents; the multi-cast bar's offset; addon memory usage.
Each is a feature this client does not have, and the stub is the honest shape
of that.

CORRECT ANSWERS THAT LOOK LIKE STUBS (9)

IsMacClient is false because it is not one. GetAdjustedSkillPoints is zero
because WotLK has no skill points - skillframe.lua gates every purchase verb
on it, which is why BuySkillTier and AddSkillUp are unreachable rather than
unimplemented. GetCurrentMapDungeonLevel is zero because a map with no floors
is on floor zero.
