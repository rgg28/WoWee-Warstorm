"""Client capabilities FrameXML cannot reach.

A verb on GameHandler that only this client's own windows ever call is a
capability that disappears the moment its element is handed over. That is how
"cannot apply a sharpening stone" happened: completeItemUseOnItem had exactly
one caller, inventory_screen.cpp, and bags are in the defaults.

Reports verbs called from src/ui/ but never from src/addons/ - the Lua
bindings being the only way FrameXML can reach anything.

WHAT IT FOUND, AND THE SIXTY-SIX LEFT (2026-08-05)

The find was the slash-command registry. Twenty-one rows pointed at
src/ui/chat/commands, which is not a window at all - it is this client's
command set, dispatched from its own chat input and from nowhere else. Handing
chat over made seventy-one commands untypeable and nothing said so, because
FrameXML answers an unknown command with "Type /help for a listing of
commands". They are bridged into SlashCmdList now, and those rows are counted
separately above rather than reported.

The sixty-six left divide cleanly, and none is a gap:

  * **Not verbs at all (17)** - set*Callback, consume*, clear*Pending. Wiring
    between this client's own halves. The is_verb filter cannot tell a callback
    setter from an action because both are camelCase with an object.
  * **The other direction (1)** - runInterfaceCommand, and it is the top row
    with twenty-seven callers. This is the client calling *into* FrameXML, so
    finding it absent from src/addons is exactly right.
  * **The glue screen** - requestCharacterList, selectCharacter. Character
    select runs before FrameXML exists.
  * **The 3D world** - interactWithGameObject, interactWithNpc, lootTarget,
    tabTarget, setMouseoverGuid. Driven by clicks in the world and by
    keybindings, not by anything the interface calls.
  * **Has a bound equivalent** - inspectTarget is InspectUnit, dismissPet is
    PetDismiss, startCraftQueue is DoTradeSkill, sendAlterAppearance is
    ApplyBarberShopStyle, stablePet is ClickStablePet. All five are bound; the
    client method simply is not the route FrameXML takes.
  * **Window plumbing** - openMailCompose, setSelectedMailIndex,
    setVendorCanRepair, showDeathDialog and friends. State belonging to this
    client's own window, which FrameXML replaces whole rather than driving.

THE QUESTION WORTH RE-ASKING

Not "what did this client's window draw" - the handover tables answer that -
but **what was it the only route to**. A verb reachable from one panel and
nowhere else disappears with that panel, and nothing in the takeover machinery
is watching for it.
