"""Draw surfaces this client renders that no handover can switch off.

Every duplicate found so far had the same shape: FrameXML draws a thing, this
client draws the same thing, and nothing connects the two. `frameXmlOwns`
gating is how a client surface steps aside -- so a surface reached without
passing a gate CANNOT step aside, whatever element set is named at runtime.

Zone text was exactly that and was found by eye. `framexml_unaccounted_frames`
could not see it: that tool walks FrameXML's frames and asks which element
mentions them, so it only finds gaps among names someone already listed. This
one walks the other side -- this client's own ImGui draw calls -- and asks
which are unreachable-from-a-gate. It needs no element list to work.

Reports, per ungated draw function, the call path that reaches it. Being
listed is not a bug: plenty of surfaces have no FrameXML counterpart (the
login screen, the settings panel, the GM console). The question to ask of
each row is "does FrameXML draw this too?" -- and for those, the answer is
either a gate or a suppression entry.

Known false-positive class, deliberately not filtered: a surface can be gated
at its *data source* rather than at its draw. `renderUIErrors` is reached
unconditionally and draws nothing, because the callback that fills its list
returns early when FrameXML owns the element. That is a real gate one layer
up, and no reachability walk over draw calls can see it. Check where a listed
surface gets its contents before believing the row.

THE TWENTY-EIGHT IT REPORTS TODAY, ALL CHECKED

Two faults were found in this list on 2026-08-05, both live since the branch
started, and both had been skimmed past twice because they sat among rows that
are fine. A report nobody can triage at a glance gets skimmed - so the triage
lives in ACCOUNTED below, one line of reasoning each, and the question this
tool now answers is whether a row is NEW.

The question that separates a fault from a row that is fine is not "does
FrameXML draw this too" but "does FrameXML draw this too *without being
asked*". A duplicate only happens when both sides put something on screen in
response to the same event. A window with its own toggle has a FrameXML
counterpart and cannot collide with it: two ways to open a thing is not two
things on screen.

  * Fixed: renderBgInvitePopup - CONFIRM_BATTLEFIELD_ENTRY, raised by
    battlefieldframe.lua from UPDATE_BATTLEFIELD_STATUS, which this client
    fires. Two accept buttons on every battleground invitation.
  * Fixed: renderLogoutCountdown - the CAMP and QUIT popups, raised by
    uiparent.lua from PLAYER_CAMPING and PLAYER_QUITING, both fired here.

WHAT THE FIRST VERSION OF THAT LIST GOT WRONG

It was a map from surface to the element it would collide with, and four of its
seven entries were claims nobody had checked. WatchFrame raises no toast when a
quest completes; AlertFrame_OnEvent in 3.3.5 handles achievements and dungeon
rewards and no loot at all; RaidInfoFrame is opened from a button. A fifth,
written while correcting the other four, said 3.3.5 had no titles UI -
PlayerTitleFrame is on the paperdoll.

Writing an unverified judgement into a tool is the thing a tool is for
catching, and the correction is why this is an allowlist rather than a map: it
holds only what was read, and says nothing about what it has not read.
