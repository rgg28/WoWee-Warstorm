"""Member functions that are declared, defined, and never called.

    tools/dead_symbol_check.py

WHY

The GameHandler decomposition and the FrameXML transition both left work
behind: a function whose last caller moved elsewhere still compiles, still
links, and still passes every test. SpellHandler kept a whole item-use path
this way, three methods and a helper, reachable only from each other. A
trainer-categorisation island lasted longer than that.

Dead code is not merely clutter here. Two of it are worse: someone reads it as
the way a thing is done and copies it, or someone wires it up years later and
gets a version that stopped being maintained the day its caller left.

WHAT IT DOES

Reads member function declarations out of the headers, then counts uses of each
name across the whole tree, ignoring the declaration and the out-of-line
definition. A name with no uses left is a candidate.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, AND WHY IT REPORTS RATHER THAN JUDGES

  * A virtual called through a base class pointer looks unused on the override.
  * Anything reached from Lua by name, which is a string literal here.
  * Anything reached through a function pointer or a dispatch table.
  * Constructors, destructors and operators, which are skipped outright.

It also misses a call split across lines, where the name sits on a
continuation with no statement keyword in front of it.

**The counted surface is src/, include/, tests/ and tools/ - and tools/ holds
516 more C++ files than anyone remembers, including the whole standalone world
editor.** A grep scoped to src/ and include/ says "dead" about functions the
editor calls, and the editor is not in the default build, so nothing local
disagrees until CI builds it. That happened: loadTerrain was removed on the
strength of a narrow grep while this scan was correctly counting ten uses, and
two of five CI jobs caught it. **Trust this over a hand grep, and build
`--target wowee_editor` before believing any removal.**

So a hit is a question, not an answer, and the answer is the build: remove the
declaration and the definition together, compile, and a live one fails to
resolve. That is a complete oracle for anything not reached through a virtual,
a function pointer or a Lua name, which is why those three are filtered out
before removing rather than argued about afterwards.

Every fix to this file so far has been the same bug in a different disguise: a
line that is not a declaration parsed as one, so its call sites were discarded
and the function looked dead. `foo(a, b);`, `return Class::foo(a);` and
`: foo(x);` have each done it. When a name with obvious callers shows up here,
suspect the parser before the codebase.

# `void foo(...)` / `bool foo(...) const;` inside a class body. Deliberately
# narrow: a return type, a name, an open paren, ending in a semicolon.
#
# The return type has to start with a word character, which also keeps a
# ternary continuation like `: getModelMatrix(x);` from parsing as one. Letting it start with
# whitespace makes `    foo(a, b);` - an ordinary call - parse as a declaration
# of foo with an empty return type, and then every call site is discarded as
# "the declaration" and every function looks dead. That is what the first
# version of this did, and it reported 682 of 3167 functions as unused.
# A statement keyword before the name makes `return foo(x);` and `else bar();`
# parse as declarations too, which discards their call sites the same way.
