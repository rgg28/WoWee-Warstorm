"""Audit an asset-pack overlay and disable the parts of it that break the game.

A third-party model pack is not a patch this client can take whole. It replaces
files that already worked, and it does so with art built for a later client:
models whose textures it forgot to ship, and character models drawn from an art
set this client has no compositor for. Taking such a pack whole is how you get a
naked player with segmented limbs and white statues in Stormwind.

The rule this applies is: a pack may ADD freely, and may REPLACE only where the
replacement is complete. Everything it fails on is disabled by removing it from
the overlay manifest, which is the whole of what makes a file reachable - the
files stay on disk so a decision can be reversed by re-running with a different
rule rather than by extracting again.

Three things get disabled, each for a reason measured rather than assumed:

  1. Character models, and everything tied to them. The HD player models carry
     a different geoset set (they have no 1, 701 or 1501 - no default hair, no
     ears variant 1, no "wearing nothing" cloak) and their skins carry three
     times the vertices. The client picks equipment geosets by number and
     composites a 512x512 body texture; neither survives the swap. The .anim
     files go with them: keyframes for an HD skeleton against the base model is
     the "weird arms and legs" half of the same fault.

  2. Models missing a real texture. A missing reflection or environment map only
     costs shine and is kept. A missing base texture renders the model white,
     which is what the Stormwind lion statue and the funerary banner became.

  3. CharSections.dbc, which is what points the compositor at _HD art. The
     client says so itself: "is 512x256 but its region on this 512x512 body is
     256x128 - mismatched art sets".

CreatureDisplayInfo is not dropped but rewritten: the pack re-points 13953
display ids, and 13648 of them land on HD humanoid models - the same ones from
(1). Those are reverted to what the base game had, one integer field per row, so
the string block stays exactly as it was. The 305 that land on creature models
are kept, and they are the part of this pack that works.

        #                 the resolution, same parts in the same places.
        #                 Downsampling hands back the stock picture. Not a fault.
        #   troll male    the same story.
        #
        #   draenei       stock is a side profile with the ear and horn beside
        #                 it; the HD one is a front-facing whole head with two
        #                 eyes and a mouth. A different layout, so no scaling
        #                 puts it right.
        #   tauren        stock is a side profile of the head; the HD one is a
        #                 front-facing muzzle with nostrils and rows of teeth.
        #                 The same different-layout fault.
        #
        # So it is a list, and it is a list because the distinction is visual.
        # A size test was tried first and reverted dwarf and troll for nothing.
        # Tauren and draenei, and the reason is now a tested one rather than a
        # theory.
        #
        # Their HD faceLower is a different picture from the stock one, not a
        # larger one: a front-facing head where the stock is a side profile, a
        # muzzle seen head on where the stock is the side of a head. The obvious
        # answer was that it wanted a bigger canvas - 512x256 is exactly the
        # faceLower region of a 1024 atlas - so the compositor was taught to
        # grow, and it was placed at its own size with nothing resampled.
        #
        # It is still wrong. So the sheet does not belong in that region at any
        # size, and where it does belong is not something the region table
        # knows. Until that is found, these two use the art the game shipped,
        # which fits the models exactly.
        #
        # Dwarf and troll are NOT here. Their HD art is a faithful 2x of the
        # stock art - same parts in the same places - so the grown canvas gives
        # them theirs at full resolution, which is the whole point of it.
