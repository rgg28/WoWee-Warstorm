"""Sort a session's missing-API report into the ones worth acting on.

    tools/framexml_missing_api_triage.py [path-to-missing_api.txt]

The report a session writes is measured rather than inferred, which makes it
the most valuable thing a run produces - and also the most misleading, because
most of what lands in it is correctly absent. Every entry has been triaged by
hand three times now and the answer keeps coming back "not a gap", so this
asks the question the same way each time instead.

The one thing this can decide, and the whole reason it works: a name FrameXML
*defines somewhere* but that was not defined at shutdown belongs to a file that
did not load. Nearly always that is a load-on-demand addon nobody opened - the
raid frames, the combat text, the time manager. Those need nothing.

WHAT THE CATEGORIES MEAN
------------------------
* **in an addon that did not load** - defined under Data/interface/addons.
  Correct: it resolves when the panel is opened. Only suspicious if the panel
  *was* opened this session.

* **defined nowhere in this interface** - two different things wear this label,
  so it prints the callers and you read them:
    - Blizzard's own dangling references. 3.3.5 ships several. `CaptureBar_Hide`
      is named in worldstateframe.lua's ExtendedUI table and defined in no file;
      `OptionsFrame_ToggleSubCategories` is assigned from XML while the function
      that exists is `OptionsListButton_ToggleSubCategories`. Both assign nil in
      the real client too. Defining them would diverge from retail, not fix it.
    - Frames the C client creates. worldmapframe.lua says so in a comment -
      "PlayerArrowEffectFrame is created in code: CWorldMap::CreatePlayerArrowFrame()".
      This client draws its own world map, so those stay absent on purpose.

* **assigned nil at file scope** - `ZonePVPType = nil` in zonetext.lua. Lua
  cannot tell "assigned nil" from "never assigned", so the recorder cannot
  either. Permanent false positive.

* **widget field** - a field read off a frame, not a call. Usually optional and
  guarded at every read; `TextString` is only set on bars that have a text
  FontString. Worth a look when the field is one the interface always expects.

* **worth reading** - everything left. This is the output that matters.
