// Dump the Lua the emitter produces for one interface XML file.
//
//     framexml_emit Data/interface/framexml/floatingchatframe.xml
//
// The client can already write this out for a whole run with
// WOWEE_FRAMEXML_EMIT_DIR, and that needs a run. This is the same emitter over
// one file, which is what most questions actually want: whether an attribute
// survived, what a $parent substituted to, which CreateFrame type a template
// child ended up with.
//
// Written after three separate guesses about why the chat edit box had no
// focus - that parentKey was dropped, that it was dropped for frames as
// opposed to regions, that the edit box was not created as an EditBox. All
// three were wrong, and one command each would have said so:
//
//     framexml_emit .../floatingchatframe.xml | grep -n 'editBox'
//
// A hypothesis about emitted output is cheap to test and expensive to assume.
// It also compiles what it emitted, because "the frame was written out" and
// "the file the frame is in will load" are different claims. A syntax error
// anywhere in a chunk takes down every frame in that file, and the frame-name
// check cannot see it: the name is in the text either way.
//
// Exit codes: 0 fine, 1 the XML did not parse, 2 the emitted Lua did not
// compile. The Lua is printed either way, so a syntax error can be looked at.
