"""Bindings that return fewer values than FrameXML unpacks.

`local a, b, c = GetThing()` with a binding that pushes two leaves c nil, and
nil is only an error when something touches it - so this shows up as a missing
column, a nil concat much later, or nothing at all until the one path that
reads the last value.

Approximate by construction: it takes the largest `return N` in the function
body against the largest left-hand side in FrameXML. Both are upper bounds, so
a hit means "worth reading", not "wrong". Prints its own parse counts so a zero
can be told from a silent failure.

One false-positive shape, seen and worth knowing before acting:

  * **A widget method sharing a global's name.** The binding tables hold both
    globals and widget methods, and this cannot tell them apart.
    `GetCursorPosition` is a global returning x and y *and* an EditBox method
    returning one character offset; resolving the name to the method makes the
    global look short by one.

THE FOURTEEN IT REPORTS TODAY, ALL CHECKED

None is a fault. Read once so the count can be watched rather than re-triaged,
and so a fifteenth stands out.

  * A name that is both a global and a widget method (1). GetCursorPosition
    the global answers two values; GetCursorPosition the edit-box method
    answers one, and this cannot tell them apart - the same caveat
    api_shadowing_check carries. The caller in blizzard_battlefieldminimap
    reaches the global.
  * Missing values that are correctly nil (6). UnitName's second return is the
    realm, which is nil on your own; UnitPowerType's last three are the
    alternate power bar's colour; GetSpellLink's second is a trade-skill link;
    GetActionInfo's fourth is a vehicle spell id; QuestPOIGetIconInfo's fourth
    is an objective index; GetQuestWorldMapAreaID's second is a dungeon floor.
    Each caller either guards or passes the nil straight into something that
    does.
  * Features that are absent, answering one nil where several are unpacked (7).
    The knowledge base, the world map's debug objects and zone map, the
    battlefield vehicle list, the quest item drop. Answering more nils would
    change nothing: the first one already tells the caller to stop.
