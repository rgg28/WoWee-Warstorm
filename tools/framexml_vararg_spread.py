"""Bindings whose returns are spread into a vararg call, answering nothing.

    tools/framexml_vararg_spread.py

WHY THIS FINDS WHAT THE OTHER SWEEPS CANNOT

framexml_short_returns compares a binding's push count against what FrameXML
*unpacks by name* - `local a, b, c = X()`. That reads nothing here, because at
these call sites nothing is unpacked at all. The binding sits as the last
argument of a call, and Lua spreads every value it returns into that call's
varargs. The count is the payload.

So a binding that returns nothing is not a wrong answer, it is an empty one:
the call still happens, the loop inside it runs zero times, and the subsystem
behind it does nothing at all. Nothing raises. Nothing is missing. Every sweep
that asks "is this name bound" says yes.

Found 2026-08-06, and it was the whole of chat:

    ChatFrame_RegisterForMessages(self, GetChatWindowMessages(self:GetID()))

ChatFrame_OnLoad registers a chat frame for no CHAT_MSG_ event whatsoever -
every one of them comes from that line, which walks the names it was handed,
looks each up in ChatTypeGroup and calls RegisterEvent for the events in it.
GetChatWindowMessages answered zero values. Zero groups, zero registrations,
and a chat window that showed nothing from login to logout while the client
parsed, coloured and routed every message correctly.

WHAT IT COMPARES

Lua functions declared with a trailing `...`, called with a binding call in
final argument position, against C bindings that can return zero values. A
binding is counted as "can answer nothing" when a `return 0` is reachable in
its body without having pushed anything - which is both the stub spelling
`(void)L; return 0;` and the real one that returns early on a bad index.

An early `return 0` on a *guard* is usually right: a bad window index should
answer nothing. What matters is whether the ordinary path can also answer
nothing, so a binding whose only statement is a bare `return 0` is reported
loudly and one with pushes elsewhere is reported as worth a look.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

A vararg callee reached through a local alias, or one whose declaration this
sweep cannot find because it is built at runtime. And it says nothing about
whether the *values* are right - only whether there are any.
