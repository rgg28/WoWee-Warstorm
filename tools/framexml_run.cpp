// framexml_run - load FrameXML for real and run an expression against it.
//
// Every static sweep in tools/ works on the text: which names exist, which
// arguments line up, which frames are emitted. They are at their floor, and
// the bugs that are left are not visible in text - they are what happens when
// the interface actually runs. Escape opening nothing, the chat box refusing
// focus, a panel that stays empty: each is a Lua error raised inside a handler
// and swallowed, because a handler that raises looks exactly like a handler
// that decided to do nothing.
//
// Run it a second way before believing a clean report:
//
//     WOWEE_LUA_API_FALLBACK=0 framexml_run Data/expansions/wotlk
//
// By default an unknown global answers with a stand-in rather than nil, which
// keeps a file alive past a name nothing implements - and hides that it was
// needed. With the fallback off, anything the interface actually depends on
// raises and names itself. As of 2026-08-07 that run is clean: no load errors,
// no addon failures, no login errors. It found the one thing that was not -
// Blizzard_BattlefieldMinimap, held up entirely by a stand-in for a frame the
// real client creates in C++.
//
// A clean default run and a failing fallback-off run is the shape to watch
// for: it means something is leaning on the stand-in and will fall over for
// anyone who turns it off.
//
// Clicking is the other thing to do with it, and it found the Send Mail tab
// raising before its frame was built. Walk the globals for tables carrying a
// widget id and a script table, keep the Buttons and CheckButtons, and Click()
// each one - but only where IsVisible() is true. Clicking a button in a panel
// nobody opened raises for reasons that are not faults: 516 of them against
// zero for the visible ones. Open a panel, click what became visible, hide it,
// move on.
//
// This is that run, without the client. The addon manager loads the real
// FrameXML through the real emitter into a real Lua state with the real
// bindings, and the only thing missing is a game behind them - every binding
// already guards its GameHandler pointer, so a null one gives the answers of a
// player who is not logged in. That is enough for anything whose fault is in
// the interface rather than in the data, which is what the swallowed errors
// are.
//
//     framexml_run <expansionDir> [expression ...]
//
//     framexml_run Data/expansions/wotlk 'ToggleGameMenu()' 'ChatFrame1EditBox:Show()'
//
// The expansion's directory, not the Data root: given the root it finds no
// FrameXML, loads nothing, and reports no errors.
//
// Errors are collected rather than printed as they happen, so the load and
// each expression are reported separately: an error during load is a different
// question from an error the expression caused.
//
// Exit status is the number of expressions that raised, capped at 100, so a
// script can ask "did this one still work" without reading the output.
