"""Two functions that are the same function, written twice.

    tools/function_similarity_check.py

WHY

duplicate_block_check.py reads a sliding window of twelve code lines and is at
zero. That does not mean there is no duplicated knowledge left: most functions
here are shorter than its window, and it only sees literal repetition, so a
copy that has been reworded is invisible to it.

This compares whole function bodies instead, which catches both. What it found
on its first run, with the block scan reporting nothing:

    M2Instance::updateModelMatrix / WMOInstance::updateModelMatrix
        Identical. The two had disagreed about the rotation composition order
        for a long time - and nothing on flat ground can tell X,Y,Z from
        Z,Y,X, which is why four attempts to fix it were each judged against
        evidence that could not.
    EntitySpawner::getRenderFootZForGuid / getRenderPositionForGuid
        Fourteen identical lines resolving a guid to the instance that draws
        it, in three functions, all of which have to agree.
    CorpseMarkerLayer::clearTexture / PlayerMarkerLayer::clearTexture
        A Vulkan teardown of a texture and its ImGui descriptor set, written
        four times counting the destructors, each needing both halves in the
        right order.
    MountDust::shutdown / Weather::shutdown
        The same four device resources released by the same two systems.
    SpellbookScreen::getSpellIcon / TalentScreen::getSpellIcon
        An icon cache whose two failure modes must be cached differently.

WHAT IT DOES

Extracts every function definition of five to two hundred and fifty code lines
from src/, include/ and tests/ - members and free functions, .cpp, .hpp and .h - strips
comments and blank lines, and compares bodies of similar length with difflib.

The cap was forty-three, and raising it is what found the guild roster: three
parsers of 31, 99 and 100 lines for one packet, differing in two facts, one of
which was a field the TBC copy read and threw away. A function longer than the
old cap was invisible to this *and* to the block scan, whose window is twelve
lines and which only matches text exactly - so a long reworded pair was seen by
nothing. Pairs at 0.88 or above are reported unless they
are named in SETTLED below.

Comments are stripped deliberately: two functions that differ only in how
their comment is worded are one function, and reading the comment as content
is how a first version of the pipeline sweep reported three renderers that
were fine.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

Lambdas, and anything under five code lines - which is how the box-distance
helper hid: it is three. Nor a pair whose lengths differ by more than about
eighteen code lines, which is where the bucket band stops. A pair whose
bodies were reworded past 0.88 similarity - the block scan cannot see those
either, and `repeated_literal_check.py` is the third angle for exactly that.

A zero here means nothing unless canaried: copy a real function into another
file under a new class name and confirm this names the pair.
