"""What an unset CVar reads as, said in two places, checked against itself.

A CVar the player has never touched has to answer the same to both sides of this
client or the options panel and the game disagree about the same setting.

The two sides are:

  * `GetCVar` in `src/addons/lua_system_api.cpp`, which is what the interface
    asks. Its fallbacks are what a checkbox ticks itself from.
  * `storedCVarValue(name, default)`, which is what the client reads where the
    setting is actually used - twenty-nine of them, in the combat text, the
    nameplates, the chat filters, the shadow quality and the rest.

Neither is wrong to exist. The interface needs an answer before anything is
stored, and the client needs one at the point of use. What they must not do is
differ: a `fctHealing` that answers 0 to the panel and 1 to the client draws
healing numbers over an unticked box, and the player's only way to fix a setting
that is already doing what they want is to tick it twice.

Nothing else here would notice. Both values are individually reasonable, both
sides work, and the disagreement only shows up on screen - which is the same
shape as the login screen's parallax scale and the preset table that had drifted
in four of ten columns.

Reads the source rather than running anything, so it costs nothing and holds for
files that start using either side after this was written.

The `||` chains matter. A branch may test several names before pushing one
value - `n == "fctdamage" || n == "fcthealing" || n == "fctdodgeparrymiss"` -
and a pattern that only takes the first name reports the other two as having no
answer at all. That is what the first version of this did, and it named two
CVars as unanswered that are answered on the same line.
