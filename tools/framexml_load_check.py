"""Files the interface asks for that are not there.

A manifest entry or a <Script file="..."> that resolves to nothing does not
raise. The loader logs a line among thousands and carries on, and what is lost
is every function that file defined - so the failure surfaces later and
somewhere else, as a global that is nil for no visible reason.

That is not hypothetical here. ToggleCharacter lives in characterframe.lua,
which the manifest does not list at all: it is pulled in by a <Script> element
inside characterframe.xml, and the reference is spelled CharacterFrame.lua
against a file that is lowercase on disk. Every step of that resolves today,
and this is what says so tomorrow.

    tools/framexml_load_check.py

THREE THINGS IT CHECKS

  * every .lua and .xml the manifest lists exists
  * every <Script file> and <Include file> reference exists
  * the same for each bundled addon's own manifest

Case-insensitively, because the loader resolves that way and the interface is
inconsistent about it - the manifests are written in Blizzard's capitalisation
and the files on disk are not.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

Whether a file that exists also loads. A Lua error inside one takes it and
everything referencing it down, and only a run says so.
