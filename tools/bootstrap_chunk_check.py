"""A bootstrap chunk that uses a local it never declared.

The Lua the engine installs at startup goes in as a series of separate chunks.
They share globals and nothing else, so each chunk that wants the frame
metatable opens by binding it to a local of its own. Writing a method into a
chunk that never declared that local indexes a nil global instead: the chunk
fails to load, everything defined in it is lost, and the only sign is one line
in the log.

That cost a session. Two tooltip methods were added to the wrong chunk and
disappeared; FrameXML calls one of them from CursorOnUpdate, which runs every
frame, so the error repeated until the render thread fell behind and the
device was lost. The build was green throughout, and so were the tests - the
failure is in generated Lua that neither of them runs.

    tools/bootstrap_chunk_check.py

Exits non-zero when a chunk is broken, because unlike the shadowing report
this one has no false positives to weigh: a chunk in this state never loads.
