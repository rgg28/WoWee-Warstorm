"""Config keys read into a field nothing else looks at.

A value written to settings.cfg and read back out of it looks like a working
setting from every angle a check normally takes: the key is there, the value
survives a restart, the field holds what the file said. None of that asks
whether anything acts on it.

This client kept three fields from when it drew its own chat window - whether
the window was locked, and the size a resize left it. FrameXML draws chat now
and chat_panel.cpp sets no window size at all, so the width and the height were
written every run and loaded back into fields nobody asked. The comments beside
them described capturing a resize and a reference kept in sync, neither of which
existed, which is what makes this shape worth a check rather than a read-through:
it looks implemented.

So for each key the loader knows, this takes the field it is loaded into and
asks whether anything outside the loader mentions it.

Two things it does not report, both on purpose. A local variable the loader
clamps into before assigning a member is not a field. And a field the *saver*
reads is still only the file talking to itself, so the saver does not count as a
reader either - which is the whole point, the chat window's size being saved
faithfully every run.

The existing dead_setting_check covers the other side of this: a CVar an options
panel control names that nothing reads. Between them, a setting has to be acted
on somewhere whichever file it lives in.

The mirror of this - state something writes and nothing keeps - was looked for
and is not worth a check. Eight toggles write a member the settings file never
holds, and all eight are view filters: the auction house's Usable and Buyout
only, the trainer's unavailable spells, the tradeskill window's Have reagents,
the reputation list's inactive factions, the combat log's auto-scroll. Those are
session-scoped on purpose and in the real client too, and telling a filter from
a setting is a judgement no pattern here can make. Anything that should persist
has a row in the schema, and the schema's own checks cover those.
