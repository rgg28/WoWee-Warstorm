"""Widget methods FrameXML calls that answer nil, and so raise.

The global surface has its own sweep. This is the other half: `frame:Method()`
rather than `Method()`, resolved through the widget metatable instead of _G.

Three things can happen to `frame:Foo()`:

  * Foo is in the method table (`{"Foo", lua_...}`) or has a Lua shim
    (`__WoweeFrameMT:Foo` / `mt:Foo`) - it works.
  * Foo is in the no-op allowlist (`"Foo=1"`) - it answers a harmless no-op.
    Silent, and the subject of its own audit; see framexml_missing_api_list.
  * Foo is none of those - the fallback records it and **returns nil**, so the
    call raises.

This finds the third kind without needing a run. The runtime does record them
(as `widget:<name>`), but only for methods a session actually reached, and only
into a report that has to be read.

False positives to expect, and why they cannot be filtered by shape:
  * Methods FrameXML defines on its own tables and objects - a table is not a
    widget, and `:Method()` looks identical either way. The script subtracts
    every `function X:Method` and `X.Method = function` it can see, which
    catches most. It does not catch a method *assigned* from another function:
    blizzard_achievementui does `self.Collapse = AchievementButton_Collapse`,
    so Collapse and Expand are reported and are fine. Check how a name is
    defined before treating it as a gap.
  * Methods on Lua's own types (`("x"):format(...)`) - lowercase, so the
    uppercase-initial filter drops them.

WHAT IT REPORTS TODAY, AND WHY NONE OF IT IS REAL

Seven, all false positives, left in the count rather than special-cased -
a list with an exception in it stops being checkable.

  * Collapse and Expand, on the achievement buttons. The addon assigns them
    as table fields - `self.Collapse = AchievementButton_Collapse` in
    AchievementButton_OnLoad - and a field always beats the metatable, so they
    are answered. A field assignment is not a method definition and this
    cannot see one.
  * Five on dump.lua's writer object, which nothing constructs. /dump is not
    reachable here.

The nine that were real-looking before were GlueXML, and are gone now that
this reads only what the loader opens.
