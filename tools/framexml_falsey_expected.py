"""Bindings that answer "" or 0 where the interface tests for nothing.

    tools/framexml_falsey_expected.py

WHY THIS FINDS WHAT THE OTHER SWEEPS CANNOT

framexml_nil_use_check asks about names that do not exist, used where nil
raises. This asks the opposite: a name that *does* exist, answering a value
that is not nil, in a place where nil was the answer meaning "none". In Lua
only nil and false are false - an empty string is true and so is zero - so the
branch meant for "there is nothing here" never runs, and the one meant for
"here it is" runs with nothing in its hands.

Two on 2026-08-06, both showing a panel that should not have been there:

  * GetAbandonQuestItems answered "". Both callers do `if ( items )` to choose
    between ABANDON_QUEST and ABANDON_QUEST_WITH_ITEMS, so abandoning any quest
    offered "you will lose:" with nothing after the colon.
  * GetGuildBankTabCost answered 0. The panel does `if ( not tabCost )` to
    decide the guild has bought all six tabs, so a guild that owned them all
    still saw the buy screen - priced at nothing, over a button that sends.

WHAT IT COMPARES

Names the interface tests directly - `if ( X() )`, `if ( not X() )`, `and X()`,
`or X()` - against C bindings whose body pushes a constant "" or 0 and never
pushes nil at all. Both halves have to hold: a binding that can answer nil is
already able to say "none", and a name that is only ever assigned and read
later is not evidence of anything on its own.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

A test further from its assignment than ASSIGNED_WINDOW lines, or one whose
variable is passed somewhere before being tested. The window is short because a
long one starts matching a name reused further down the file.

Nor a binding that answers a *computed* zero. Only a literal push is matched,
because a computed zero is usually a real count.
