/// Alpha is treated as coverage rather than as an image throughout, which is
/// the whole difficulty. A leaf sheet is a silhouette, and a resize that treats
/// its alpha like a colour channel thins the canopy at every scale - so alpha
/// is resized without sharpening and its coverage is put back afterwards, at
/// every mip level, which the GPU's own mip generation cannot do because it has
/// no idea the texture is a cutout.
