"""Dialogs this client draws without asking whether FrameXML draws them too.

    tools/dialog_gate_check.py

"Owned or suppressed" is the rule for elements, and it applies to dialogs one at
a time rather than to the dialog manager as a whole. FrameXML answers most of
the same events with a static popup of its own - DUEL_REQUESTED, GUILD_INVITE,
ShowResurrectRequest - so a client popup with no ownership check draws beside
it: two dialogs for one question, each with its own accept button and its own
idea of what was answered.

Three of the fourteen in renderDialogs were gated and the rest were not, which
read as a decision until each was checked against what FrameXML does with the
same event. Seven were doubles, three of them on the default tier.

WHAT IT LOOKS FOR

Calls to a render*Popup or render*Dialog inside DialogManager's two dispatch
functions, with no frameXmlOwns on the same line or the two above it.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

Whether FrameXML has a counterpart at all. The two left are left on purpose and
both were re-read on 2026-08-05, this time against FrameXML's source rather
than against its event names:

  * the duel countdown - the big "3, 2, 1, Fight!" over the middle of the
    screen. FrameXML has no such thing. Its two duel dialogs are DUEL_REQUESTED,
    the accept-or-decline popup, and DUEL_OUTOFBOUNDS, the timer for leaving
    the ring. Neither counts anything down.
  * the pet-unlearn confirmation - FrameXML cannot draw one. CONFIRM_PET_UNLEARN
    is a globalstring and nothing more: there is no StaticPopupDialogs entry of
    that name anywhere in this interface, so no event would raise it and
    SMSG_PET_UNLEARN_CONFIRM is correctly silent where the talent wipe one line
    above it fires.

The earlier note here listed the shared quest and the two battlefield invites
as well, on the reasoning that the events behind them are never fired. That
reason was always the thin one - it stops holding the day someone wires the
event - and all three are gated now, which is why the count fell from five to
two. The ceiling stays a number to look at rather than a zero to trust.
