"""Settings in the schema that never reach the config file.

    tools/settings_persist_check.py

WHY

The settings screens are generated from one list - kSchema in
settings_schema.cpp - and every entry there becomes a control in both the
client's own window and the interface's options panels. Saving is not
generated: GameScreen::saveSettings writes each field out by hand, and
loadSettings reads them back the same way.

So a setting can be added to the schema, appear in both windows, answer its
value, apply correctly, and be gone at the next login. Nothing raises. The
control is there, the value works, and it resets every time the client starts -
which reads to a player as "that option doesn't stick" and to a developer as
nothing at all, because every test still passes.

Forty-nine settings were added to that schema in one session. This is the check
that says whether they will survive a relog.

WHAT IT DOES

For every schema key, finds the field it binds to in settings_panel.cpp's
binding tables, then asks whether that field is both written by saveSettings and
read by loadSettings. A field missing from either is reported.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

Whether the value written is the value meant, or whether the key names in the
file are stable across versions. It answers "is there a writer and a reader",
which is the question that was silently false.
