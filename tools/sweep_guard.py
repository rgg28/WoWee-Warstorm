"""Run the fast sweeps and fail if any of them gets worse.

A sweep only helps on the day someone runs it. Every fault these catch was
found by hand at least once, and each is the kind that raises nothing, logs
nothing and fails no test - a panel drawn twice, a binding answering short, a
name in a manifest that resolves to nothing, a chunk of bootstrap Lua replacing
the binding underneath it. Left to a person remembering, they come back.

    tools/sweep_guard.py          # report and exit non-zero on a regression
    tools/sweep_guard.py --list   # show the ceilings without running anything

Each entry pins a ceiling rather than an exact figure, so a fix that lowers a
count passes and is meant to be followed by lowering the ceiling here - a
ratchet, not a snapshot. Where the honest answer is none, the ceiling is zero
and lowering it is not possible.

These run in about a minute together, which is why they are the ones wired
into the build; the slower reports - element readiness, the unbound global
scan, the ungated-draw walk - stay manual. The line here used to say six of
them in under three seconds, and had said so for long enough that the count was
out by a factor of five: a comment about how much a thing costs stops being
true the moment someone adds to it, and this one is worth keeping honest
because it is the argument for what belongs here.
