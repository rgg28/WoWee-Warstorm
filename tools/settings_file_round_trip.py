"""Every line of the settings file, changed and read back.

The restart check drives settings through Lua, which reaches the seventy-two
rows of the schema and the six a Blizzard control drives. The file holds more
than that: where the quest tracker sits and how big it is, the chat window's
size and which tab was open, where the damage meter was left, the resolution.
Nothing reaches those from Lua and nothing else here checks them at all.

So this works on the file. A run writes it, every value in it is moved to
another value inside the range the loader will accept, and a second run loads
and writes it again. What comes back has to be what was put in.

A value moved outside its range proves nothing - the loader clamps, correctly,
and the check would be reporting its own bad arithmetic. The ranges come from
the clamps in the loader itself, which is the only machine-readable statement of
what each field will hold: a first version of this set every scale to zero and
reported five settings as lost when all five had been held to their minimum
exactly as intended.

The keybindings at the end of the file are moved too, onto keys the manager can
put a name to - it writes F1 through F12, single letters and a few named keys,
and nothing else - and that nothing is bound to. Not onto W, A, S, D, Q or E:
those are reserved so they cannot become UI shortcuts, and a binding onto one is
refused. Both of those cost a run to find, each looking like the file losing
bindings.

One key is expected not to survive and is named below rather than tolerated
silently.

Needs build/bin/framexml_run and an extracted interface, and skips rather than
fails without them.
