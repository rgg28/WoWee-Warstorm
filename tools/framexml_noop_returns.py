"""Widget no-ops whose answer someone reads.

    tools/framexml_noop_returns.py

THE GAP THIS FILLS

`framexml_unbound_widget_methods` asks whether a method resolves at all, and
counts the no-op allowlist as answered. For "does this call raise on the spot"
that is right. It is wrong for the caller that uses what comes back: a no-op
returns nil, and nil compared against a number raises exactly as an absent
method does - one line later, in a different function, which is why it reads
as a different bug.

GetFieldSize is the case that prompted this. It sat in the allowlist, so both
of the existing sweeps called it answered. Its one caller in all of FrameXML
is GuildEventLog_Update, which reads it into `max` and compares a running byte
count against it. The comparison raised on the first guild event carrying a
message and the SetText at the end of the function never ran, so the log was
blank whenever it had anything in it and correct whenever it did not.

WHAT IT LOOKS FOR

Calls to an allowlist-only method whose result is consumed on the same line,
split by what the consumption does:

  raises   arithmetic, comparison, concatenation, indexing, or a `for` limit -
           nil in any of these is an error, so the enclosing function stops
  silent   assigned to a name, or returned, or passed as an argument - the nil
           travels, and where it lands has to be read
  fine     called for effect, or tested for truth (nil is falsy, which is what
           a no-op is for) - not reported

A NO-OP WHOSE NIL IS THE DOCUMENTED ANSWER, AND MUST STAY ONE

SetDesaturated, and it is worth naming because it is the shape someone
"fixes". itembuttontemplate.lua - which backs every item button in the
interface - writes:

    local shaderSupported = icon:SetDesaturated(desaturated);
    if ( not desaturated ) then r, g, b = 1.0, 1.0, 1.0
    elseif ( not r or not shaderSupported ) then r, g, b = 0.5, 0.5, 0.5 end
    icon:SetVertexColor(r, g, b);

The variable's own name says nil is expected: no shader, so dim it with vertex
colour instead. The no-op returns nil, the fallback runs, and unusable and
locked items grey out correctly - verified down to the draw, where textures are
tinted by packColor(w->color, w->alpha) and SetVertexColor writes that colour.

Binding SetDesaturated to return true without actually desaturating would take
that fallback away and leave every unusable item at full brightness. This one
is right as it is.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

Where a nil goes once assigned. The silent tier is a list to read, not a list
of bugs; most no-ops are no-ops because nothing wanted the answer. It also
cannot tell a widget from a plain Lua table. Names FrameXML defines on its own
tables are subtracted, which covers the common case - FramePositionDelegate's
GetUIPanel was four of the first five findings - but a method *assigned* from
another function rather than declared is not seen. Check what the receiver is
before acting on a row.
