"""Settings the player cannot reach from any control.

A setting is bound to a field, applied, saved and loaded whether or not
anything can change it. Three things give a player a way to set one: a schema
row, which draws a control on this client's own panel; an entry in kClientCVars,
which maps a Blizzard control onto it; and a graphics preset, which sets several
at once. A setting with none of the three can only be changed by editing
settings.cfg by hand.

Three are in that state deliberately and are listed below with the reason. Any
other is a setting that was added without a way to use it.

Canaried by removing a schema row, which reports that key.
