/**
 * cli_catalog_paths.hpp - turning a path the user typed into the base name a
 * catalog writes.
 *
 * The formats are stored as "<base><extension>" and their JSON sidecars as
 * "<base><extension>.json", and a user may type either, or neither, or the base
 * on its own. Working back to the base was written out in every import handler,
 * in two different spellings that had to agree - and one of them measured the
 * suffix with a hardcoded 10, which is the length of ".wxxx.json" and would be
 * wrong for any extension that is not four letters.
