/**
 * cli_validate_report.hpp - how a --validate-* handler reports what it found.
 *
 * Every catalog format validates the same way: collect errors, collect
 * warnings, then say so either as JSON for a script or as text for a person,
 * and exit non-zero if there were errors.
 *
 * Only two things differ between the 138 formats - the file's extension, and
 * the one line describing what "OK" means for that format ("3 slots, all
 * slotIds unique, no UI overlaps"). Everything around those was copied into
 * every handler, which is why a format's JSON report and its text report could
 * ever disagree about anything.
