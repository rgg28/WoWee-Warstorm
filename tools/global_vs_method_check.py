"""Globals FrameXML calls that exist here only as a widget method.

    tools/global_vs_method_check.py

WHY THIS IS NOT COVERED BY THE UNBOUND-GLOBAL SWEEP

framexml_unbound_globals decides a name is bound by finding it registered
somewhere under src/addons. Widget methods register by name exactly as globals
do, so a method is enough to make a global read as answered - and the global
stays nil, and every FrameXML call of it raises.

GetText was that, and it sat there for months. FrameXML's GetText(token, gender)
looks a global string up with its gendered variant, and ReputationFrame_Update
builds every standing label with it. Meanwhile
`set("GetText", lua_FontString_GetText)` registers a FontString method of the
same name. The static sweep counted the global bound; the reputation list raised
on open regardless. Only the runtime missing-API report could tell them apart,
and only after someone opened that panel.

WHAT IT LOOKS FOR

A name that is (a) called by FrameXML with no `:` or `.` in front of it, so it
is meant as a global, (b) registered as a widget method here, and (c) not
registered as a global anywhere and not defined by FrameXML's own Lua.

All four conditions matter. Dropping (c) reports every method whose name is also
a real global - HasFocus, GetName, SetText - which is most of them. Dropping the
Lua-definition check reports names FrameXML answers itself.

THE RELATED SHAPE THIS DOES *NOT* REPORT

The reverse collision, where a global and a method share a name and both exist.
That is api_shadowing_check's list, and it is noise there for the same reason:
this codebase registers both through the same mechanism, so HasFocus the
edit-box method and HasFocus the focus query look like one name written twice.
Two live examples of the confusion that causes: GetCursorPosition is both the
EditBox caret index (one value) and the global cursor position (two), which made
framexml_short_returns report the global as answering short; GetText is both a
FontString reader and the global above.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

It reads calls, not reachability: a name called only from a file nothing loads
would still be counted, which is why loaded_files does the filtering.

Both sides come from framexml_provides, which is the one implementation of
"does the client answer this name". This tool rolled its own for a day and
missed 407 globals - everything registered through the bootstrap or the
counting table rather than a {"Name", lua_Name} row - and every one of those
would have been reported here as a global existing only as a method, which is
the exact false gap that file was written to stop.

Verified failable: deleting the GetText global from lua_system_api.cpp takes
this from zero rows to one, naming GetText.
