"""This client's own slash commands, and whether FrameXML's chat can reach them.

    tools/client_command_bridge_check.py

WHAT HANDING CHAT OVER TOOK AWAY

ChatPanel keeps a registry of slash commands - about a hundred and ninety
aliases - and it was dispatched from exactly one place: this client's own chat
input, in chat_panel.cpp, after SlashCmdList and before the emote fallthrough.

FrameXML's edit box does not know that registry exists. ChatEdit_ParseText
walks SlashCmdList and consults nothing beyond it, so the moment chat became
FrameXML's, every command the registry answered and the interface did not
stopped being typeable. Seventy-one of them: /unstuck and its two siblings,
/coords, /loc, /whereami, /zone, /transport, /threat, /instance, /difficulty,
/players, /online, /screenshot, the helm and cloak toggles, the GM helpers.

Nothing raised. Typing one produced FrameXML's "Type /help for a listing of
commands", which reads exactly like a command that never existed.

WHAT IT COUNTS

Registry aliases with no FrameXML SLASH_* equivalent **and** no bridge. The
bridge is the bootstrap chunk in addon_manager.cpp that walks
__WoweeClientCommandNames() after FrameXML has loaded and registers whatever
the interface has not already claimed. With it, this is zero; without it, it is
the full seventy-one.

So the number is the answer to a real question rather than a proxy for one, and
removing the bridge is what makes it fail.

WHY THE BRIDGE RUNS AFTER FRAMEXML AND NOT BEFORE

The taken set has to be complete or a client command shadows an interface one.
That fault has happened here: SLASH_FOLLOW1 through 7 are FrameXML's, the
client's chat tried SlashCmdList first, and /follow landed on a no-op while a
working followTarget sat unused.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

Whether the command *works* once reached - only that the name resolves. And it
reads aliases out of the C++ by pattern, so a command registered some other way
than an aliases() override is invisible; the count printed first is what says
whether that parse is still finding them.
