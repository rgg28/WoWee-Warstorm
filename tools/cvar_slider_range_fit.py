"""Blizzard's sliders, against the range this client will accept from them.

The interface declares a range beside each slider it draws -
`{ minValue = 16, maxValue = 64 }` for Ground Density, `0.5` to `1.5` for Mouse
Sensitivity - and those sliders write CVars this client binds to settings of its
own. The two do not always count the same thing, and when they do not, the
slider hands over a number the setting has no room for.

Both faults that produced this looked fine from either end:

  * Ground Density counts doodads, 16 to 64. The setting is a proportion, 0 to
    1.5. Every one of that slider's seven positions came out as the most clutter
    the client draws, and the value written to the config was clamped back down
    on the next load, which made it permanent.
  * Mouse Sensitivity is a multiplier around 1.0, 0.5 to 1.5. The setting is an
    amount that sits at 0.2 and stops at 1.0. The slowest setting that slider
    offered was two and a half times the client's default.

Neither shows up as a slider that does nothing, which is what a check would
naturally look for: each position wrote a different number. What made them wrong
is where those numbers landed, so this follows the whole chain rather than the
ends of it -

    the interface's declared range
      x the scale on the kClientCVars row
      x 100 where the binding is a fraction
      against the range the config loader clamps that field to

and reports a slider whose ends do not fit. The loader's clamp is used as the
statement of what the client accepts because it is the one the client applies to
the same field, in machine-readable form, for settings that have no schema row -
which these are, the six with no row being exactly the ones a Blizzard control
drives.

The declared range is not always the offered one. `kOptionRangeFixesLua`
rewrites some of these tables at start-up, because a slider can ship on a scale
this client does not measure in - the gamma slider offers -0.5 to 0.5 where
GetGamma answers 1 for a neutral screen, so every position on it asked for a
nearly black picture, which is this same fault in a control that is not bound
through kClientCVars. The overrides are read too, or this would compare against
numbers the client never uses.

It also checks that two sliders over one value offer the same range. One
setting has two: Mouse Sensitivity and Mouse Look Speed both write this client's
mouse sensitivity. Fixing the first with a scale while the second passed its
number through left them disagreeing - one read 1.0 where the other read 0.2,
and moving either put the other somewhere it could not show. That was a fix for
this file's own first finding, and it is the reason the check is here.

Canaried two ways: taking the scale off a binding reports that slider's ends
landing outside what the setting holds, and scaling one of a shared pair without
redefining its range reports the pair as disagreeing.

Data/interface is not in the repository, so this skips rather than fails when it
is absent.
