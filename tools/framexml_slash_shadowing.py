"""Client slash commands that FrameXML shadows with a handler that does nothing.

This client's chat tries SlashCmdList before its own registry and returns as
soon as it finds a handler - and dispatchSlashCommand returns true even when
that handler *errors*. So any command FrameXML defines wins, working or not.

/follow was found this way: SLASH_FOLLOW1..7 cover /f, /follow and /fol, all
landing on a no-op FollowUnit while the client's own /follow sat unreachable
behind it.

Reports only where both sides claim the same command AND FrameXML's handler
bottoms out in a stub or a missing global - that is the pairing that loses a
working feature.

Split into two lists, because a dead call is worth very different amounts
depending on what is beside it. A handler with NO live call cannot do anything
at all. A handler with a dead call beside a live one usually has the dead one on
a branch that never runs: /ignore reads BNet_GetPresenceID, which resolves to
GetAutoCompletePresenceID answering nil here and falls through to AddOrDelIgnore,
and /leave gates BNLeaveConversation behind a channel number above ten and
otherwise calls LeaveChannelByName. Both commands work.

Filtering the second list away was tried and is wrong: an IGNORE handler whose
only real call was replaced by a name nothing binds still had UnitIsPlayer and
SendSystemMessage in it, so "has a live call" stayed true and the fault
vanished from the report. Listing both is the honest arrangement.

This sweep sees which names a handler mentions, never which branch runs - so
read the whole handler before believing a hit, and before dismissing one.
