"""A sound sample collection that is loaded at start-up and never played.

THE SHAPE

An audio manager declares a collection, fills it from disk in its loader, and
reports it in a log line - and nothing ever plays it:

    std::vector<CombatSample> bloodElfMaleAttackSounds_;   // declared
    bloodElfMaleAttackSounds_.resize(9);                   // filled
    loadSound(path, bloodElfMaleAttackSounds_[i], assets); // read from disk
    LOG_INFO("... BE Male: ", bloodElfMaleAttackSounds_[0].loaded ? ...);

Every mention is the load or a log line about the load. The files are read at
every start-up and the sound cannot be triggered by anything.

WHY IT MATTERS, AND WHY THE COUNT IS NOT THE POINT

Found this way once, the answer was 34 collections and 109 wav files. But the
same symptom had three different causes, and they wanted opposite treatment:

  - a duplicate of a path that already works, per race, from a general
    system - delete it, because wiring it in gives every jump two voices;
  - a fallback nobody could reach, where the primary path is a dbc lookup
    and only an install missing that dbc would ever need these - wire it;
  - a feature that was loaded and never finished - decide, and if it cannot
    be finished, remove the load and keep the note saying what it needed.

So a hit here is a question, not a verdict. Read who else plays that kind of
sound before deciding which of the three it is.
