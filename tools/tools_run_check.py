"""Sweeps that no longer run at all.

    tools/tools_run_check.py

WHY

sweep_guard runs about thirty of these and fails when one of them gets worse.
Nothing runs the rest, and a sweep nobody runs does not merely go stale - it
breaks, and the breakage is indistinguishable from the sweep being fine.

Two broke on 2026-08-05 from one edit. The candidates tier in
framexml_takeover.cpp became empty, its `for (const char* name : {...})` loop
was removed with it, and two tools parsed that loop with a regex and called
.group(1) on the None they got back. handover_halves_check is wired into
sweep_guard, so ctest caught it inside a minute. framexml_live_stubs is not,
and it sat crashing until someone happened to run it - which is the failure
this exists to make impossible.

WHAT IT DOES

Runs every tool that sweep_guard does not, and reports any that exits non-zero
or raises. It does not read their output: a sweep reporting a bad number is
sweep_guard's business, and a sweep that cannot report at all is this one's.

WHAT IS SKIPPED, AND WHY EACH

  * framexml_source, ownership_walk, opcode_map_utils - libraries, not sweeps.
    Running them does nothing and proves nothing.
  * m2_viewer, upscale_textures - tools that open a window
    or process assets. Not checks, and expensive.
  * gen_opcode_registry - a generator; running it writes files.
  * anything already in sweep_guard, which runs it and reads its number.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

A sweep that runs, exits zero, and reports a number that means nothing -
framexml_bool_vs_number's nil arm was exactly that on the day it was written.
Only reintroducing the fault finds those.
