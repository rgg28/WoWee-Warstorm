# Build WoweeAssetExtractor.app from the SwiftPM executable.
#
# SwiftPM produces a bare binary. A bare binary can draw a window, but it is
# not an app: it gets no Dock icon, no activation, and - the one that matters
# here - no drag and drop, because AppKit refuses a drag onto a process that
# LaunchServices does not know about. So the binary is wrapped in a bundle.
#
#     ./make_app.sh                     # build/WoweeAssetExtractor.app
#     ./make_app.sh --output ~/Desktop  # somewhere else
#     ./make_app.sh --identity "Developer ID Application: ..."
#
# Without an identity the bundle is signed ad-hoc, which is enough to run it
# locally but not to hand to anyone else.

# or unsuitable" and exits 1, which fails the whole script (reported on
# Swift 6.3.3 / macOS 26 in PR #127).

# locations have to be tested: guarding on the top-level one alone would skip
# the Swift 6.4 layout too, silently leaving a bundle unsigned on a toolchain
# where signing it works today.
#
# Skipping costs nothing. A resource-only bundle holds no Mach-O, so it
# carries no signature of its own and is sealed by the app's.
