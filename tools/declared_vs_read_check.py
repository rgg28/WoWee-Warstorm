"""What the interface *declares* about itself, and whether anything reads it.

Every other sweep here asks what the Lua calls. This one asks what the XML
says a frame is, and what the two sides agree a constant means. A frame can be
declared perfectly and behave wrongly when the declaration is read by nobody,
and nothing about that failure is visible: no missing name, no nil, no raise.

    tools/declared_vs_read_check.py

THREE THINGS IT COMPARES

**Attributes the emitter never names.** The chat box says historyLines="32"
and ignoreArrows="true"; the cast bar says drawLayer="BORDER". All three were
going nowhere. An attribute with no method behind it is fine to ignore -
emitting a call to a method that does not exist is worse - so this is a list to
read rather than a list to empty.

**Script handlers nothing fires.** GameTooltip declares OnTooltipCleared and
the chat box declares OnTextSet; neither had ever been called, so a tooltip
kept a money line it should have dropped and a message put into the box by
anything but typing went out on the wrong channel.

**Constants set in both places that disagree.** The bootstrap pre-sets these so
an addon has them before the interface loads - and on master the interface does
not load, so the bootstrap's values are the only ones there are.
BOOKTYPE_PET was 1 against "pet": a number compared to a string is false rather
than an error, so the question was always answered no.

WHAT IT CANNOT SEE

Whether an unread attribute matters. Most of the remainder have no method
behind them at all, and a few are XML namespace bookkeeping. Read before
acting.

THE CVARS, AND THE TEST THAT DECIDES ONE

An unanswered CVar reads as "0", so the question per name is not "is it
answered" but **does zero switch off something that works**. That is the test
the defaults table in lua_system_api.cpp was built with, and every entry in it
names the consequence: the character sheet showed two empty stat panels because
playerStatLeftDropdown answered "0" and matched no category; the chat wheel did
nothing because chatMouseScroll gates the only EnableMouseWheel call; the
keyring was unreachable because showKeyring gates the only Show.

Read that way on 2026-08-05, the rest are correctly zero. Most are preferences
a fresh account has off - lootUnderMouse, alwaysCompareItems, fullSizeFocusFrame,
displayFreeBagSlots, threatShowNumeric, the two tracker ones, miniWorldMap,
equipmentManager, the buff filters - and the remainder belong to systems that
are not here: movie recording, voice, Battle.net, the arena addon.

Three worth naming because they look like faults and are not:

  * worldMapOpacity is inverted. WorldMapFrame_SetOpacity computes
    `alpha = 0.35 + (1.0 - opacity) * 0.65`, so zero is fully opaque, which is
    what a stock client shows.
  * ShowAllSpellRanks off is the stock state and the path behind it works -
    GetSpellTabInfo returns the highest-rank offset and count as its fifth and
    sixth values precisely because SpellBook_GetTabInfo keeps those and throws
    the first pair away.
  * showTokenFrame and showTokenFrameHonor both false is not "hidden": that is
    the branch that scans the currency list and decides, which is what a fresh
    account wants.

The one left undecided is screenEdgeFlash, the full-screen combat flash. Its
default is plausibly on, LowHealthFrame exists to draw it, and unlike the
entries above it is reachable from an Interface Options checkbox - so zero
costs a preference rather than a feature, and turning a full-screen flash on
from a guess is the wrong way round.

THE SEVENTEEN ATTRIBUTES, READ 2026-08-05

Not boilerplate, and not attributes:

  * xmlns, xsi, schemaLocation on Ui - XML namespace declarations. They will
    never be read and are counted only because this reads every name in the
    schema.

No mechanism here to honour them:

  * horizTile, vertTile on Texture - eleven uses, all of them chat frame
    borders and tab backgrounds. Tiling needs a REPEAT sampler and the UI's is
    shared and CLAMP_TO_EDGE, so uv > 1 clamps instead of repeating. The cost
    of leaving it is a border strip stretched rather than tiled.
  * monochrome on Font, rotatesTexture on StatusBar, protected on Frame -
    a font flag, a fill-direction texture rotation, and secure-frame marking.
  * minimapArrowModel, minimapPlayerModel on Minimap - the player arrow is
    drawn in minimap_display.frag.glsl, not from a model.

No consequence:

  * debug, platform on Binding - build metadata.
  * nonBlocking on Texture - an async-load hint for a loader that is already
    async.
  * bytes and indented on FontString, countInvisibleLetters on EditBox,
    dontSavePosition on ScrollingMessageFrame - limits and layout niceties
    with no case behind them in this interface.

The one that came out of this list was motionScriptsWhileDisabled, and it is
worth noting why it did not belong with the rest: it read as inert, and it was
the opposite. Nothing here suppressed motion scripts at all, so every greyed
control answered the mouse - the permissive superset, which looks like the
attribute working. WoW fires OnEnter on a disabled button only when this asks,
which is how a greyed control explains why it is greyed.
