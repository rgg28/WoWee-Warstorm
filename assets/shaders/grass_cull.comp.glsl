#version 450

// GPU culling and compaction for grass blades.
//
// One thread per blade. Survivors claim a slot with a single atomicAdd on the
// draw command's instanceCount and write their own index there, so the draw
// that follows reads a packed list and the count it needs is already the
// field the indirect draw reads. Nothing is read back on the CPU.
//
// Modelled on m2_cull.comp.glsl, which writes a visibility mask for the CPU
// to compact instead. This is the first path in WoWee where the GPU decides
// how many instances to draw.

// testing one blade's position and drawing another's.
