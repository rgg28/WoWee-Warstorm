#version 450

// A grass blade: a tapered strip of five segments bent along a quadratic
// Bezier, moved by wind and by whoever walks through it.
//
// The player interaction is ported from m2.vert.glsl. The wind is not, any
// more: it began as that system's constants, and was reworked into travelling
// waves - fronts that sweep across the field and gusts that roll through in
// bands - because grass in place-to-place unison reads as a texture, and a
// field the wind visibly crosses reads as weather. Phase still comes from
// world position and never from the frame (spec §36).
//
// Some blades have gone to seed and some carry blooms. Which ones is decided
// here, from the blade's own seed and a slow world-space patch function, so
// seeding drifts across a meadow in swathes rather than speckling it evenly -
// and the same blade is the same blade on every frame and every rebuild.
